            <h2>Growing</h2>

            <p>Run into food dots to grow.  Run into smaller players to eat
                them and grow even more.  Fly near larger players to drain some
                of their size.</p>

            <img src="../images/tutorial/border-green.png">
            <p>
                A green border means you can eat this player because you
                are larger.  Try to catch them!
            </p>
            <img src="../images/tutorial/border-yellow.png">
            <p>
                A yellow border means you can eat this player, but you are
                only slightly larger.  Speed boosting to catch them is
                risky.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/tutorial/border-red.png">
            <p>
                A red border means this player is larger than you, so be
                careful!
            </p>

            <h2>Scoring Points</h2>

            <p>You'll score points any time your sphere grows, but you
                never lose points even if your sphere shrinks.</p>

            <p>Now go eat 'em up!</p>
